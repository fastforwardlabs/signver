## Dev Notes


## Code Practices
Where possible we will explore the following conventions

- Type hinting with python (i.e. add types for method variables and return types)
- Code formatter - Black


## Todos
- Localizer
  - Formalize evaluation code harness and plot charts for multiple localizer models and their performance
  - Find new examples of image data with signatures
- Data
  - Write a datasheet document for how each of the models are trained
